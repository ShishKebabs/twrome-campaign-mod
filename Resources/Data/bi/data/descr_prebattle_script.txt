;;Prebattle scripts - added for HD, previously hardcoded
;;If multiple scripts are valid for a battle, one will be selected at random
;;To play a line simply do 'line "LINE_ID"'
;;Line IDs and such are controlled in the sound descrs
;;Note that if you are successfully ambushed you won't ever have a speech

;;If you need help with this ask Jenni, it took me 3 days to make this dammit

;; line types in the base game as of 02/02/2021:

;; "Trait opening/middle/closer" - bits that can be defined by a general's traits
;; "Oneliner" - does what is says on the tin, it's a single line that works by itself
;; "Enemy" - say something about the main enemy, depending on relationship
;; "Enemy allies" - say something about enemy allies, depends on relationship
;; "Enemy no allies" - laugh about the enemy having no friends
;; "Our allies" - say something about our allies
;; "Battle context" - say something about what this battle means, i.e. are we recovering an
;;                    eagle, committing 25% of our total forces, defending our last city?
;; "Battle type" - talk about the type of battle, i.e. siege, river crossing, ambush
;; "Numbers" - talk about the sizes of the armies relative to eachother
;; "Strength" - talk about the relative strengths of the armies
;; "Terrain" - talk about any terrain features in our or the enemy's deployment zones
;; "Troop comparison" - anything specific about the units, i.e do we have a lot of horses?
;; "Previous Record" - how well have we done against this faction in the past?
;; "Omens" - what does the oracle say?
;; "Reinforcements" - are reinforcements on their way?

;; THE COMMA AFTER THE line NAME IS VERY IMPORTANT, IF SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING CHECK THAT FIRST

;; line options:

;; weight - simple weighting, only of use inside random_selections
;; chance - the chance that the line will be used
;;          (n.b. inside a random_selection this is if the line will be considered AT ALL,
;;           not the chance that it will be used in any given choice)
;; exclusive - indicates that if this line is used it shouldn't be repeated after this point
;; force_cheer - force this line to be followed by a cheer

;; logical operations:

;; random_selection [min, max] - choose a random amount from the selection between max and min
;; if [valid, chance] - used to check if a line is valid and play a set of lines as appropriate

;; note that max and min units are based on the total number of troops on both sides

;; TESTING NOTE: this is read when loading into a battle, if you make a change and then restart the
;; battle then any changes will be applied immediately.

;;include this at the start to disable loading the script from lower mods/the base game
