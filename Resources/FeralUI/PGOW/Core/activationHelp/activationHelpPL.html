			<h2>What is Activation?</h2>
			<p>Activation is a method of copy protection, which helps ensure you are running a licensed copy of a Feral game.</p>
			<p>To activate your game, you will need a <strong>Product Key</strong>, which is only provided with genuine copies of Feral games.</p>
			<p>Once you have entered your <strong>Product Key</strong>, you can then choose either:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="#dvd" title="Jump to section">Play with the game DVD</a> in your Mac’s DVD drive (providing you own the DVD version of the game).</li>
				<p><strong>or</strong></p>
				<li><a href="#online" title="Jump to section">Activate the game online</a> by sending the <strong>Product Key</strong> to Feral’s servers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will need to do one of these two things before you can play.</p>
			
			<h2>Entering the <strong>Product Key</strong></h2>
			<p>If you own the DVD version of the game, you will find the <strong>Product Key</strong> on the back of your printed manual. It will look like this:</p>
			<div id="activationHelpKeydemo">
				<h3>Product Key</h3>
				<p>S3UT-YY47-CS3P-45UK-QW4N-3YAU</p>
			</div>
			
			
			<p>Please note, this <strong>Product Key</strong> is just an example, and will not work for any of our games!</p>
			<p>If you downloaded the game from an online vendor, you will have received a <strong>Product Key</strong> via an e-mail or web page at the time of purchase. If you cannot find your <strong>Product Key</strong> after downloading the game, please contact the vendor for assistance.</p>
			<p>The first time you start the game after installing it, the pre-game <strong>Options window</strong> will appear, showing the <strong>Activation tab</strong>:</p>
			
			<img src="ui/1_initial-en.png" alt="1_initial-en"/>
			
			
			
			
			
			  
			
			<p>Enter your <strong>Product Key</strong> into the six empty boxes. Once the <strong>Product Key</strong> has been entered, the <strong>Save button</strong> below the boxes will activate. Click the <strong>Save button</strong> to save your <strong>Product Key</strong>. The appearance of the upper half of the <strong>Activation tab</strong> will change so that it looks like this:</p>
			
			<img src="ui/2_serial-entered-en.png" alt="2_serial-entered-en"/>
			
			
			<p>If you own the DVD version of the game, you will now have a choice between activating the game online or playing with the disc in the drive. </p>
			<h2 id="dvd">Playing using the DVD</h2>
			<p>If you own the DVD version of the game, you can play it without online activation by clicking the <strong>Play with DVD button</strong>. You may only do this after you have entered and saved your <strong>Product Key</strong>. The DVD must be present in your Mac’s DVD drive in order for the game to launch.</p>
			
			<h2 id="online">Playing using Online Activation</h2>
			<p>If you prefer to play the game without the DVD in the drive, or if you downloaded the game, you must activate the game online.</p>
			<p>To do this, click the <strong>Activate Online... button</strong> in the <strong>Activation tab</strong>. </p>
			<p>A dialog box (shown below) will appear confirming that your <strong>Product Key</strong> will be sent to Feral. Click the <strong>Activate Online button</strong> in the dialog box.</p>
			
			<img src="ui/3_activating-en.png" alt="3_activating-en"/>
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Activation tab</strong> will update showing you the number of machines you are allowed to activate the game on and how many machines you currently have activated.</p>
			
			<img src="ui/4_activated-en.png" alt="4_activated-en"/>
			
			
			<p>You may now play the game without a disc in the drive or an internet connection.</p>
			
			<h2><em>I’ve tried activating the game and I am stuck.<br/>What should I do?</em></h2>
			If you are experiencing problems activating your game, click on the 
			<strong>Contact Feral... button</strong> on the <strong>Activation tab</strong>. A drop-down dialog box will appear:
			
			
			
			<img src="ui/5_contact-en.png" alt="5_contact-en"/>
			
			
			
			<p>Type your e-mail address into the <strong>E-mail field</strong> and a summary of your problem into the large field, then click the <strong>Send Query button</strong> to send it to the Feral Support team. Please note, this form should only be used for issues relating to the activation system.</p>
			
			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h3 class="question">Do I have to activate the game for each user account on my Mac?</h3>
			<p>No. Once you have activated the game, it will work for all user accounts on that computer.</p>
			<h3 class="question">Can I activate the game at a later date?</h3>
			<p>Yes, you can activate or deactivate the game online at any time.</p>
