; feral_descr_tonemap_lut - Maps all the pertutations of weather and climate to a texture name that contains 
; 							the hue shift that should be done in mentioned contidions
;
; Syntax: name 		<texture_name>
;         map       <map_name>
;		  climate	<climate_type>, [optional]<climate_type>...
;		  season	<season_type>,  [optional]<season_type>...
;		  weather	<weather_type>, [optional]<weather_type>...
;		  daytime 	<daytime>,		[optional]<daytime>...
;
; Notes: - The LUT assignment is done in the order they are described here, so a lower LUT assignment will overwrite previous ones
;
;        - The LUT map determines if the LUT is used for the campaign or 3d battles / settlement view
;
;		 - In the campaign we only use season and daytime to pick the LUT
;
;        - Assinging multiple climates/weathers to a LUT will make it so that LUT is used for all combinations of climates/weathers
;
;		 - climate_types, weather_types, daytime_types can be defines as shorthand for any set of climates/weather/daytimes
;
;		 - Weather types that can be used: calm, hazy, dense_fog, light_fog, rain_drizzle, rain_storm, sand_storm, snow_falling, blizzard
;
;		 - Daytimes that can be used: midnight, sunrise, mid_morning, morning, midday, sunset, mid_evening, night
;
;		 - If you DON'T mention one of the parameters for a texture then ALL the posibilities are being assigned
;
;		 - Make sure to use Windows line endings, it massively messes up stuff if you don't
